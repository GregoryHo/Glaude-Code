# CRITICAL: Archon-First Task Management

When ANY task management scenario arises:
1. **Use Archon MCP server as PRIMARY task system** - Check and update Archon tasks first
2. **TodoWrite is ONLY for granular subtask tracking** - Use after Archon setup for personal tracking
3. **This overrides all other task management patterns** - No exceptions

**VIOLATION CHECK**: If you used TodoWrite before checking Archon, restart with Archon first.

# Development Guidelines

## Philosophy

### Core Beliefs

- **Incremental progress over big bangs** - Small changes that compile and pass tests
- **Learning from existing code** - Study and plan before implementing
- **Pragmatic over dogmatic** - Adapt to project reality
- **Clear intent over clever code** - Be boring and obvious

### Simplicity Means

- Single responsibility per function/class
- Avoid premature abstractions
- No clever tricks - choose the boring solution
- If you need to explain it, it's too complex

## Process

### 1. Planning & Staging

Break complex work into 3-5 stages. Document in `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`:

```markdown
## Stage N: [Name]
**Goal**: [Specific deliverable]
**Success Criteria**: [Testable outcomes]
**Tests**: [Specific test cases]
**Status**: [Not Started|In Progress|Complete]
**Archon Task ID**: [task-uuid if using Archon]
```
- Create corresponding Archon tasks for each stage when available
- Update status as you progress
- Remove file when all stages are done

### 2. Implementation Flow

1. **Check Task** - If Archon available: `get_task(task_id)` â†’ `update_task(status="doing")`
2. **Research** - Use Archon RAG when available: `perform_rag_query()` + `search_code_examples()`
3. **Understand** - Study existing patterns in codebase
4. **Test** - Write test first (red)
5. **Implement** - Minimal code to pass (green), based on research findings
6. **Refactor** - Clean up with tests passing
7. **Update Status** - If Archon: `update_task(status="review")` when complete
8. **Commit** - With clear message linking to plan and task ID

### 3. Archon Research Integration

When Archon MCP is available, research before implementing:

- **Architecture & Patterns**: `perform_rag_query("[tech] patterns", match_count=5)`
- **Implementation Examples**: `search_code_examples("[feature] implementation", match_count=3)`
- **Debugging & Issues**: `perform_rag_query("[error message]", match_count=3)`
- Keep queries focused with low match_count (3-5) for relevant results

### 4. When Stuck (After 3 Attempts)

**CRITICAL**: Maximum 3 attempts per issue, then STOP.

1. **Document what failed**:
   - What you tried
   - Specific error messages
   - Why you think it failed

2. **Research alternatives**:
   - Find 2-3 similar implementations
   - Note different approaches used

3. **Question fundamentals**:
   - Is this the right abstraction level?
   - Can this be split into smaller problems?
   - Is there a simpler approach entirely?

4. **Try different angle**:
   - Different library/framework feature?
   - Different architectural pattern?
   - Remove abstraction instead of adding?

## Technical Standards

### Architecture Principles

- **Composition over inheritance** - Use dependency injection
- **Interfaces over singletons** - Enable testing and flexibility
- **Explicit over implicit** - Clear data flow and dependencies
- **Test-driven when possible** - Never disable tests, fix them

### Code Quality

- **Every commit must**:
  - Compile successfully
  - Pass all existing tests
  - Include tests for new functionality
  - Follow project formatting/linting

- **Before committing**:
  - Run formatters/linters
  - Self-review changes
  - Ensure commit message explains "why"

### Error Handling

- Fail fast with descriptive messages
- Include context for debugging
- Handle errors at appropriate level
- Never silently swallow exceptions

## Decision Framework

When multiple valid approaches exist, choose based on:

1. **Testability** - Can I easily test this?
2. **Readability** - Will someone understand this in 6 months?
3. **Consistency** - Does this match project patterns?
4. **Simplicity** - Is this the simplest solution that works?
5. **Reversibility** - How hard to change later?

## Project Integration

### Learning the Codebase

- Find 3 similar features/components
- Identify common patterns and conventions
- Use same libraries/utilities when possible
- Follow existing test patterns

### Tooling

- Use project's existing build system
- Use project's test framework
- Use project's formatter/linter settings
- Don't introduce new tools without strong justification

## Quality Gates

### Definition of Done

- [ ] Tests written and passing
- [ ] Code follows project conventions
- [ ] No linter/formatter warnings
- [ ] Commit messages are clear
- [ ] Implementation matches plan
- [ ] No TODOs without issue numbers

### Test Guidelines

- Test behavior, not implementation
- One assertion per test when possible
- Clear test names describing scenario
- Use existing test utilities/helpers
- Tests should be deterministic

## Important Reminders

**NEVER**:
- Use `--no-verify` to bypass commit hooks
- Disable tests instead of fixing them
- Commit code that doesn't compile
- Make assumptions - verify with existing code

**ALWAYS**:
- Commit working code incrementally
- Update plan documentation as you go
- Learn from existing implementations
- Stop after 3 failed attempts and reassess
